Social Media Analytics Dashboard- Power BI
1. Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst Internship.
The objective was to design and develop an interactive Social Media Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze tweet performance through advanced analytical logic and dynamic visualization techniques.

The dashboard evaluates engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, replies, impressions, media views, and interaction clicks using structured business rules and DAX-based calculations.

2. Project Objectives

Analyze tweet engagement performance across multiple dimensions

Implement time-based dynamic visualization controls

Apply conditional filters (odd/even date logic, character/word count conditions)

Perform median-based comparative analysis

Build structured and professional dashboard visuals

Demonstrate advanced DAX and analytical problem-solving skills

3. Dashboard Components
Task 1 – Media Engagement vs Media Views Analysis

Developed a scatter chart to analyze the relationship between media views and media engagements

Highlighted tweets with engagement rate greater than 5%

Applied conditional filters:

Replies > 10

Odd tweet dates

Word count > 50

Visible only between 6PM–11PM IST

Task 2 – Interaction Click Analysis by Tweet Category

Created a clustered bar chart showing URL clicks, profile clicks, and hashtag clicks

Categorized tweets based on media, links, and hashtags

Applied filters:

Even tweet dates

Word count > 40

Visible between 3PM–5PM IST

Task 3 – Top 10 Tweet Performance

Identified top 10 tweets based on total likes and retweets

Excluded weekend tweets

Applied:

Even impressions

Odd dates

Word count below 30

Time-based visibility control

Task 4 – Monthly Engagement Rate Trend

Built a line chart to display monthly average engagement rate

Compared tweets with media vs without media

Applied advanced filtering conditions:

Even engagement values

Odd dates

Character count above 20

Removal of specific text conditions

Time-restricted visualization

Task 5 – Above-Median Media Engagement Comparison

Compared replies, retweets, and likes for tweets exceeding median media engagement

Limited analysis to June–August 2020

Applied:

Odd dates

Even media views

Character count > 20

Conditional text removal logic

Task 6 – App Open vs Non-App Open Engagement Analysis

Compared average engagement rate between tweets with and without app opens

Included weekday tweets between 9AM–5PM

Applied:

Even impressions

Odd dates

Character count > 30

Conditional text removal

Dynamic time-based visibility
